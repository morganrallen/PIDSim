PID Controller visualization
----------------------------

Right now this is very much a brain dump. Its mostly working but features to
turn this into a proper learning tool can be added.

Wishlist
--------
* Better car model/animation
* Better road animation (move road instead of looping)
* Improve code editor (maybe move P,I,D outside to prevent mid edit resets?)
* Start off with broken/no PID equation
* Plot all PID terms
* Unify all visual assets into single SVG
* Unify coordinates
